1. **Download and Setup**
   - Download the latest `Jisui-kindle2pdf.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/RyuheiRay/Jisui-kindle2pdf/releases) page and extract it.

2. **Launch the App**
   - Double-click `Jisui-kindle2pdf.exe` in the extracted folder to start.

3. **Prepare Kindle (Left Button)**
   - Click the **"1. Open Kindle"** button to launch the Kindle app.
   - Open the book you wish to convert.

4. **【Important】Manual Layout Adjustment**
   - **Adjust Appearance**: To ensure the best reading experience on your device (e.g., Remarkable2), you **must manually adjust the font size, font type, column width, and margins** via the "Aa" menu in the Kindle app.
   - **Reason**: This tool captures the screen exactly as it appears. These adjustments directly determine the readability of the final PDF.
   - **Display Mode**: Ensure the app is set to "Single Page View" (not two-page/spread view).

5. **Start Conversion (Middle Button)**
   - Click the **Arrow Button (2. Start!)** to begin.
   - **[Note]**: The tool will automatically navigate to the first page and enter full-screen mode. Please do not touch your mouse or keyboard until the capture process is complete.

6. **Check the PDF (Right Button)**
   - Once finished, click the **"3. Open Folder"** button. Your completed PDF will be waiting in the `result` folder.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Stability
- **Manual Click**: Due to Windows OS restrictions, if the Kindle app doesn't automatically come to the foreground, click the Kindle window manually immediately after pressing "Start."
- **Disable Sleep Mode**: For long books, ensure your PC is set not to sleep during the conversion process.
